Xcode errors:
  Error:
    Library 'DoubleConversion' not found
  Solution:
    To fix it you need to check "Build Settings" -> "Targets" -> "Architectures" -> "Excluded Architectures" and verify that arm64 NOT excluded from the project, if it excluded you should remove it for running simulator on m1 chip.
