After finally getting app to build for first time after like 2 weeks, got the error
every time I tried to open the app:
  Error:
    https://github.com/Shopify/flash-list/issues/1221
  Solution:

What actually helped build:
  Was having issues and kept generating Podfile s through AI (GPT and claude)
  and kept getting errors
    Most common error:
      react-native-pdf package is getting error in file 'Optional.h':
      ".../ios/Pods/Headers/Public/RCT-Folly/folly/Optional.h:667:10
      'folly/experimental/coro/Coroutine.h' file not found" while using
      react-native 0.76
  So I used the default Podfile and messed around with the react native version
  number and 0.74 worked. It didn't work automatically. I got the error shown
  and the solution from the link:

Other Xcode errors (didn't help):
  Error:
    Library 'DoubleConversion' not found
  Solution:
    To fix it you need to check "Build Settings" -> "Targets" -> "Architectures" -> "Excluded Architectures" and verify that arm64 NOT excluded from the project, if it excluded you should remove it for running simulator on m1 chip.
